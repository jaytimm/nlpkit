\title{Identify Clusters in Data using DBSCAN}
\usage{
llm_id_clusters(df, eps = 0.1, minPts = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the points to be clustered.
The data frame should have at least two columns named 'x' and 'y'.}

\item{eps}{The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered as in the same neighborhood (DBSCAN parameter).}

\item{minPts}{The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point (DBSCAN parameter).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original data plus 'cluster', and 'remove_flag' columns.
}
\description{
This function applies DBSCAN clustering to a data frame and marks each point as belonging to a cluster.
It also identifies representative points in each cluster and flags non-clustered points as 'noise'.
}
\examples{
# Example usage
# df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10))
}
