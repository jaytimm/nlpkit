\title{Find Nearest Neighbors Based on Cosine Similarity}
\usage{
x_get_neighbors(x, matrix, n = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector (term) or numeric vector.}

\item{matrix}{A matrix against which the similarity of 'x' is calculated.}

\item{n}{The number of nearest neighbors to return.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the rank, terms, and their cosine similarity scores.
}
\description{
This function calculates the nearest neighbors of a given term or vector
based on cosine similarity using a specified matrix.
It returns the top 'n' nearest neighbors.
}
\examples{
# Example usage
# matrix <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 10)
# wd_get_NN("example_term", matrix, 5)
}
